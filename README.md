# Predict-Backorder
Insofe Internship Project
Product backorder may be the result of strong sales performance (e.g. the product is in such high demand that production cannot keep up with sales). However, backorders can upset consumers, lead to canceled orders and decreased customer loyalty. Companies want to avoid backorders, but also avoid overstocking every product (leading to higher inventory costs).
